### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

In order to find the exact fonts for my website, I visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the options.
For the overall content I have decided to use the [Spartan](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spartan?query=spartan#standard-styles "Google fonts: Spartan") font. In my opinion this font is easy to read and visually appealing.
For my headings I decided to go with a different font in order to make them stand out from the main content. The font I choosed for this, is the [Julius Sans One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Julius+Sans+One?query=ju#standard-styles "Google Fonts: Julius Sans One") font.
This is a bit rounded uppercase font what matches with the overall font.

#### Icons

I have decided to implement icons, using the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). I will make sure that the icons are styled according to the website. I will use some icons to make the website more visually appealing but not to overtake the content.

#### Colors

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## **Wireframes**

I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
First I created a basic wireframe for desktop and later on for tablet and mobile. 
For my website I have decided to use a scroll page as it's focused on searching objects in a big amount of data.
The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar.

You can find my wireframes below:
